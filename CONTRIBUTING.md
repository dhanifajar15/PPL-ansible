> **Note:** we're still working on our contributing process, as we're a young project. If you'd like to suggest or discuss changes to this document or the process in general, we're very open to suggestions and would appreciate if you reach out on Facebook Group or at [contact@cloudboz.com](mailto:contact@cloudboz.com)! To suggest additions to this document, feel free to raise an issue or make a PR with the changes. 

## Reporting Issues

> **IMPORTANT:** If you've found a security issue, please email us directly at [contact@cloudboz.com](mailto:contact@cloudboz.com) instead of raising a public issue. Bug reports help make CloudBoz better for everyone. To create a bug report, select the "Bug Report" template when you create a new issue. This template will provide you with a structure so we can best recreate the issue. Please search within our issues before raising a new one to make sure you're not raising a duplicate.

## Development Process Overview 

We officially build new releases every other Friday, but we merge new features and fixes to our hosted version as soon as those features are ready. If the PR can get reviewed and merged before the next release, we will add it to our public roadmap for that upcoming release (https://github.com/cloudboz/projects), which gets announced to the community every other Friday.

### Good first issues and bug fixes

> **Note:** if you're a first-time contributor, we recommend that you [follow this tutorial](http://makeapullrequest.com/) to learn how to start contributing. If the issue is very limited in scope or only requires changes to a few localized files. If you'd like to be assigned an issue, feel free to reach out on Discord or over email, or you can simply comment on an issue you'd like to work on. 

### Improving Documentation and Writing Tutorials

Documentation is hosted at [docs.cloudboz.com](https://docs.cloudboz.com). To update existing documentation, you can suggest changes directly from the docs website. To create new documentation or write a tutorial, you can add a document in the [repository](https://github.com/cloudboz/documentations) and make a PR directly. 

### Features

If you'd like to suggest a feature, please use a **#suggestions** on Facebook Group that we frequently check to see which new features to work on. We require that all features have a detailed spec written in a PR **before** work on that feature begins. We will then review that spec in the PR discussion until the spec is clear and accomplishes the end goal of the feature request. 

## Writing Code 

Our backend is written in Golang, and our frontend is written in Typescript (using React). 

Happy developing!
